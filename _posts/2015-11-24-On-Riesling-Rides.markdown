Description: What is a Riesling Ride? In essence it is a ride where the goal is not to ride the quickest, nor the furthest, nor up the biggest hills. It is instead a distillation of what makes cycling great. The point of the experience is the journey, riding at a speed where the pace is leisurely and for three hours anything and everything is able to enter the discourse.

What is a Riesling Ride? In essence it is a ride where the goal is not to ride the quickest, nor the furthest, nor up the biggest hills. It is instead a distillation of what makes cycling great. The point of the experience is the journey, riding at a speed where the pace is leisurely and for three hours anything and everything is able to enter the discourse. More than that it is a voyage of discovery, riding and exploring both new roads and old favourites. The Riesling Ride doesn’t discriminate based on ability, and is often prone to spontaneous outbursts of singing. On a recent Riesling Ride, described by one attendee as ruined owing to the overly strenuous route, Sufjan Stevens was quoted, “I should’ve known better.” This deviation from the norm was a lesson learnt. The route should be an equal mix challenging and recreational but when the Riesling becomes corked, it is time for reassessment.

Ernest Hemingway mused that, “It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them.” In a true Riesling ride there should be a sense of joy, in riding through our Alsace, that is the hills of Warrandyte, Watery and Broad Gullies. Even if their isn’t a glass of Riesling waiting at the end of the ride, one should remember that on a Thursday morning, Riesling is a state of mind, a bridge to nowhere.
